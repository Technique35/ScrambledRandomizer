# Pokémon Scrambled Scarlet Randomizer v1.0.0

A randomizer for the ROM Hack "Pokémon Scrambled Scarlet" created by doozsromhacks.

## Features
- User interface
- Generate random, daily, or custom seeds.
- Choose between two different gameplay styles:
  - **Teamlocked:** The intended way to play. Carry a team of six Pokémon throughout the game, only replacing them after they faint. After every boss, you'll get a new encounter.
  - **Unique Teams:** Tackle each boss fight in the game with a new set of six Pokémon. For experienced players who want to test their knowledge and team building skills.
- Automatically generate Natures, Tera Types, and genders and forms for certain Pokémon like Minior and Paldean Tauros.
  - Also generates extra Tera Types if you need to reroll a Tera Type after evolving.
- Disable certain Pokémon - or entire boxes - to prevent them from being used in the seed. Useful for challenge runs, or if you simply don't want to use certain Pokémon.
